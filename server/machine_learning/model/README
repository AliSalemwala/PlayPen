Usage is very simple. In your favorite terminal, execute:

python model_cli.py --predict [PRED_LIST]

Notice that PRED_LIST should contain 697 elements inside, seperated by spaces, not commas

You can also change the path to the model by using --model_path MODEL_PATH flag

Requirements that should be satisfied in the current Python workspace (dependencies):

Numpy
Pickle
